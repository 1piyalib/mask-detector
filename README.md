This AI code running on a tiny edge computer (Raspberry Pi) with a camera can detect if someone has a
mask on and remind people to wear their masks. We downloaded images from the
internet, categorized, normalized and augmented the images, trained a standard image
categorization model of Tensor flow (using Python) in the PC. Then, we moved the
trained model file to the Raspberry Pi to apply mask detection from the video stream.
This small $65 fully functional prototype device can be placed in strategic locations like
outside the bathroom, where students are most likely to forget wearing a mask coming
out. The device requires no Wi-Fi, no data storage, and an optional monitor. We are
hoping solutions like this will help reduce the spread, make the school community safer,
and have students come back to school sooner. Demo: https://youtu.be/LuqQU0ElwEI
